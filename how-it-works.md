NovaBid Vendor Guide: How It Works

Purpose

This guide explains how NovaBid works from a vendor’s perspective. It is intended for sellers who want controlled price discovery, qualified demand, and trust-backed auction outcomes.

What Is NovaBid?

NovaBid is an event-driven auction platform where vendors create time-bound lots and allow qualified buyers to compete transparently.

Vendors define the rules once. NovaBid enforces them automatically.

Key Concepts for Vendors

Lots

A lot is a single auction instance created by a vendor. Each lot specifies:

Product or service details

Auction duration

Pricing model (starting price, reserve, increments, etc.)

Buyer eligibility requirements


Lots are immutable once live, ensuring buyer trust.

Bids

Bids submitted by buyers are:

Signed and time-stamped

Validated against lot rules

Ranked deterministically


Vendors cannot alter or reorder bids.

Events

Every action in NovaBid is captured as a signed event. This creates:

Full auditability

Strong dispute resolution

Compliance-ready records

Vendor Workflow

1. Create a Lot

Vendors define auction parameters upfront, including:

Description and media

Pricing rules

Auction timing

Buyer qualification requirements


Clear rules reduce unqualified participation and post-auction friction.

2. Publish and Monitor

Once published:

The auction runs autonomously

Bids are validated and processed in real time

Vendors can monitor activity without intervention


NovaBid prevents bid spoofing, replay, and manipulation.

3. Demand Discovery

NovaBid excels at revealing real demand:

Competitive bidding exposes true willingness to pay

Time limits reduce negotiation fatigue

Even unsold lots provide pricing insight


This allows vendors to refine future offerings.

4. Auction Close

At close:

The system finalizes results strictly based on predefined rules

No retroactive changes are possible

Buyer trust is preserved by design


The outcome is deterministic and verifiable.

5. Fulfillment & Settlement

After closing:

Vendors receive the winning bid and buyer details

Settlement proceeds according to lot configuration

A complete event trail is available for records or compliance
